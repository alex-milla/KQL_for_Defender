# Defender KQL Queries

This repository contains various KQL queries that I use in my daily work with Microsoft Defender. Some KQL scripts may be based on, or inspired by, the work of others such as Steven Lim, Sergio Alba, and others.

Feel free to use, adapt, or contribute to these queries as needed.
